# Object-Oriented Programming And Functional Programming

## Object-Oriented Programming

1. Introduction
- Goals
    - Programs as collections of collaborating objects
    - Object has public interface, hidden implementation
    - Objects are classfied according to their behavior
    - Objects may represent real-world entities or entities that produce services for a program
    - Objects may be reusable across programs
- Characteristics
    - Data abstraction
        - Escapsulation
        - Information Hiding
    - Polymorphism
    - Class Hierachy
        - Diamond Problem in Mutilple Hierachy
    - Inheritance
    - Dynamic binding
- OOP languages
    - Some are pure OOP language (e.g., Smalltalk).
    - Newer languages do not support other paradigms but use their imperative structures (e.g., Java and C#).
    - Some support procedural and data-oriented programming (e.g., Ada and C++).
    - Some support functional program (e.g., Scala).
